Visualizer for Conway's Game of Life.

The `javascript` folder is the one that matters. The `python` folder is some skeleton code for when I thought about doing it in Python.

## Prerequisites
To open the visualizer, you need Google Chrome and an internet connection. It should work on other browsers, but they're not tested.

To load new data, you need `python` and `numpy` installed.

## Instructions
To open the visualizer, open `javascript/index.html` in Google Chrome.

To load new data, go to the `javascript` directory and run
```
$ python csv_to_js.py --csv_file <PATH_TO_CSV.csv>
```
